# Neyo's 100Days-ML

This is a programming training task of Machine Learning which was conducted after
"100 Days of Machine Learning Coding" as proposed by [Siraj Raval](https://github.com/llSourcell)

Let me show my appreciation here to the original author's works and contributions.
Let's start and have fun! :-)

## Day 5 | Logistic regression
Moving forward into #100Days-of-ML code today I dived into the deeper depth of what Logistic Regression actually is and what is the math involved behind it. Learned how cost function is calculated and then how to apply gradient descent algorithm to cost function to minimize the error in prediction.
Due to lee time I will now be posting an infographic on alternate days.
Also if someone wants to help me out in focumentation of code and already has some experience in the field and knows Markdown for github please contact me on LinkedIn :).
